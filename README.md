# 🎨 Etch A Sketch

A browser-based drawing board that lets you “etch” colorful sketches by hovering over a grid. Built to practice DOM manipulation, CSS grid layout, and event handling in vanilla JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Dynamic Grid**: default 16×16 cells, customizable size via user prompt  
- **Color Modes**:
  - **Brush**: draw in black  
  - **Rainbow**: each cell colored with a random hue  
  - **Shading**: cells gradually darken on repeated hovers  
  - **Eraser**: reset cells to white  
- **Clear Grid**: reset drawing board without changing size  
- **Responsive Design**: grid adapts to container size  

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Creating a **grid layout** dynamically using CSS Grid and JavaScript  
- Handling **mouse events** (`mouseover`, `mousedown`, `mouseup`) to draw only while clicking  
- Generating **random colors** and implementing **color shading** logic  
- Prompting for **user input** to adjust grid size and validating input  
- Separating **UI controls** from **drawing logic** for cleaner code  

## 📚 Assignment Summary
This project from The Odin Project’s Foundations curriculum guided me to:
1. Set up an HTML/CSS scaffold with a grid container.  
2. Write JavaScript to:
   - Generate a grid of div cells based on user-defined size.  
   - Add event listeners for drawing and erasing.  
   - Implement multiple drawing modes (brush, rainbow, shading, eraser).  
   - Clear the grid and resize when requested.  
3. Practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and CSS Grid fundamentals.
